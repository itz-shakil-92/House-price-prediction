## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on various features. The model is implemented using Python and the linear regression algorithm.

## Dataset

- Dataset source: [USA_House.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing)

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itz-shakil-92/House-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd House-price-prediction
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv

    # Unix/Macos
    source myenv/bin/activate

    # Windows use
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the model training and prediction:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

## Model

The model used in this project is a linear regression model. It was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in predicting continuous values.

## Results

The model's performance metrics and evaluation results can be found in the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
